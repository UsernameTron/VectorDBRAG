  -F "vector_store_id=vs_xxx" \
  http://localhost:5001/api/upload
```

#### Upload Best Practices
- **File Size**: Keep files under 16MB for optimal performance
- **File Names**: Use descriptive names for better search results
- **Organization**: Group related documents in the same knowledge base
- **Quality**: Ensure documents are text-searchable (not scanned images)

### üîç Search Functionality

#### Search Types

**1. Semantic Search**
- **When to Use**: Finding documents similar to your query
- **Best For**: Broad topic exploration, finding related documents
- **Example Query**: "employee benefits policies"
- **Response**: List of relevant documents with similarity scores

**2. AI-Assisted Search**
- **When to Use**: Getting specific answers to questions
- **Best For**: Fact-finding, detailed explanations, analysis
- **Example Query**: "What is the maximum vacation time for senior employees?"
- **Response**: AI-generated answer with source citations

#### Search Interface

**Web Interface Search**
1. Select search type (Semantic or AI-Assisted)
2. Choose target knowledge bases (can select multiple)
3. Enter your query in natural language
4. Review results with source citations
5. Export results if needed

**API Search**
```bash
# Semantic search
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "marketing strategies", "search_type": "semantic", "vector_store_ids": ["vs_xxx"]}' \
  http://localhost:5001/api/search

# AI-assisted search
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What are our Q4 revenue targets?", "search_type": "assisted", "vector_store_ids": ["vs_xxx"]}' \
  http://localhost:5001/api/search
```

#### Writing Effective Queries

**‚úÖ Good Query Examples**
- "What is the approval process for capital expenditures over $50,000?"
- "Compare our product performance metrics from last quarter"
- "Find safety protocols for chemical handling in manufacturing"
- "What are the requirements for remote work eligibility?"

**‚ùå Avoid These Query Patterns**
- Single word searches ("sales")
- Overly complex technical jargon
- Questions about information not in your documents
- Requests for real-time data not in uploaded files

### üìä Results Management

#### Understanding Results

**Semantic Search Results**
- Document titles and excerpts
- Relevance scores (0.0 to 1.0)
- Source file information
- Direct links to original documents

**AI-Assisted Search Results**
- Generated comprehensive answer
- Source citations with page/section references
- Confidence indicators
- Follow-up question suggestions

#### Export Options
- **JSON**: For programmatic processing
- **CSV**: For spreadsheet analysis
- **HTML**: For sharing and presentation
- **Text**: For simple text processing

### üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Features

#### Batch Operations

**Bulk File Upload**
```bash
# Upload multiple files from directory
for file in /path/to/documents/*; do
  curl -X POST -F "file=@$file" -F "vector_store_id=vs_xxx" \
    http://localhost:5001/api/upload
  sleep 2  # Rate limiting
done
```

#### Search Filtering
```bash
# Search with date filters (if supported by your documents)
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "budget reports", "filters": {"date_range": "2024"}}' \
  http://localhost:5001/api/search
```

#### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Check system performance
curl http://localhost:5001/health

# Monitor knowledge base processing
curl http://localhost:5001/api/vector-stores/{store_id}/status
```

### üîí Security & Privacy

#### Data Protection
- All files are encrypted in transit to OpenAI
- API keys are stored securely in environment variables
- No data is permanently stored by OpenAI after processing
- Local file uploads are handled securely

#### Access Control
- Knowledge bases are isolated by ID
- API endpoints require proper authentication
- Audit logs track all system activities

#### Privacy Considerations
- Documents are processed by OpenAI's APIs
- Ensure compliance with your organization's data policies
- Consider on-premises deployment for highly sensitive data

### üö® Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**1. API Key Errors**
```bash
# Test API key
curl http://localhost:5001/api/test-api-key

# Fix: Check .env file or run setup script
./setup_api_key.sh
```

**2. File Upload Failures**
- Check file size (must be under 16MB)
- Verify file format is supported
- Ensure internet connection for OpenAI processing

**3. Search Not Working**
- Verify knowledge base contains processed files
- Check that vector store status is "completed"
- Ensure query is in English (other languages have limited support)

**4. Application Won't Start**
```bash
# Check dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Check port availability
lsof -i :5001

# Use different port
python app.py 5002
```

#### Getting Help

**1. Check Logs**
```bash
# Application logs show in terminal
python app.py

# Check for error messages in browser console (F12)
```

**2. Validate Configuration**
```bash
# Check all settings
cat .env

# Test system health
curl http://localhost:5001/health
```

**3. Reset and Restart**
```bash
# Stop application (Ctrl+C)
# Clear any cached data
rm -rf __pycache__/
# Restart
python app.py
```

### üìà Best Practices

#### Document Organization
- Create separate knowledge bases for different topics
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Regularly update and remove outdated documents
- Maintain document quality (clear, well-formatted text)

#### Search Optimization
- Use specific, well-formed questions
- Include context in your queries
- Experiment with both search types for different needs
- Save frequently used queries for quick access

#### Performance Tips
- Upload files during off-peak hours for faster processing
- Monitor API usage to manage costs
- Regularly clean up unused knowledge bases
- Use semantic search for exploration, AI-assisted for specific answers

#### Cost Management
- Monitor OpenAI API usage through their dashboard
- Use local caching when possible
- Optimize document sizes before upload
- Set up usage alerts to prevent unexpected charges
